# OS Benchmarking Project 

## Project Overview
This goal of this project was to perform benchmarking tasks on various aspects of an operating system. This includes the CPU, file system, memory, and networking interfaces.

The implementation for the tests can be found in each labeled directory, and the results can be found in the report linked [here](https://github.com/sbogh/cse221-benchmarking/blob/main/Boghani_CSE221_FinalProjectReport.pdf).

## Project Specifications
These particular benchmarks were designed for a system running on a VirtualBox VM. This VM was running Linux Mint 22 Xfce Edition and was allocated limited hardware resources which are detailed in the full report. For networking, two identical virtual machines were set up as the server and client.

## How to Run Benchmarks
See the instructions document found [here](https://github.com/sbogh/cse221-benchmarking/blob/main/instructions.md).
