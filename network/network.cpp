What needs to be done

- Round trip time
    - Compare application-level round trip time with the time to perform a ping using the ping command (ICMP requests are handled at kernel level)

    - Hint
        - You should implement the application-level benchmark yourself but you may use an existing ping utility for comparison.

- Peak bandwidth

- Connection overhead: Report setup and tear-down.

- Additional Details
    - Evaluate the above for the TCP protocol
    - For each quantity, compare both remote and loopback (localhost) interfaces

- Questions to keep in mind
    - Comparing the remote and loopback results, what can you deduce about baseline network performance and the overhead of OS software?
    - For both round trip time and bandwidth, how close to ideal hardware performance do you achieve?
    - What are reasons why the TCP performance does not match ideal hardware performance (e.g., what are the pertinent overheads)?
    - In describing your methodology for the remote case, either provide a machine description for the second machine (as below), or use two identical machines.
